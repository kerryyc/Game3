Final build of the game can be found in Assets/Build

A medieval-themed local co-op 2D top-down survival game where two players are knights fighting against 
waves of undead. Players must come up with different strategies to survive such as fleeing for their 
lives or mashing the melee attack button to destroy zombies. There are three waves of enemies: the first contain the 
basic skeletons, the second with a mixture of the basic skeletons and more advanced undead that shoot
fire at the players, and the last wave only containing the advanced undead.

The players should feel stressed as they try desperately to survive as the timer ticks down, but it
should not be frustrating. Viewing the time and having lives should encourage them to keep playing 
the game. They should feel relieved when they survive a wave and excited when they complete the game.

The AI in this game is the more advanced skeletons. 
Apart from being red, these skeletons constantly attempt to get to an ideal range from the player. 
The purpose of this is to get in the most optimal shooting position. 
The skeletons also retreat when the player gets too close. 
When they spawn, they target the player with the lowest amount of health, but they will change target if another player 
attacks it or if the current player dies.
